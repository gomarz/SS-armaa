Intro:
1. Trigger by bar event
2. If accept, start event where forces assemble at planet  <---
3. Have forces travel to orbit planet, make contact fleet interactable at this point 
4. Interacting with fleet and asking to proceed leads to stage 2


Stage 2
---------
1. Fleet flies to planet
2. Cannot interact with planet until defenders defeated
3. After defeat, make main fleet interactable
1. Trigger Interaction
2. set memflag that atmo battle is about to happen (right before the battle starts, last dialog input)
3. Only add ships that have ground support(?) or are <= frigate size
3. On battle start (Add this to EinhanderHax for now, but should be its own plugin for maintainability:
	- Draw the BG
	- Render it above the dust particles
	- Draw clouds? (Give it a parallax effect)
	- Draw 2nd BG with alpha for addt'l parallax?
	- BG Color(?)
	- Atmo modifiers (Reduced speed/manuverability/range?)
3. Mission - Destroy Orbital Weapon
	- Player descends from high-orbit - low-orbit - atmosphere
	- Orbital Weapon paints a location with visual fx - A closing circle?
	- Once timer ends, spawn an explosion at location
	- Increase in intensity as player descends(?)
	- Draw Orbital weapon in the background, slowly increase size as player approaches
	- At certain point, spawn in the weapon as a normal ship
4. After battle end
5. Unset memkey for simulation
6. Done

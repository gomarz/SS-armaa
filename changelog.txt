Altagrave:
-There appears to be a bug with ships that use modules that makes them much more aggressive than they should normally be. This seemingly is fixed in 0.9.5a, but if you want to prevent this behavior from occuring with AItagrave's, destroying their back module with a console command or assigning them a ship to escort resolves the issue.
-For this reason, modules no longer confer any statistical bonus/malus to speed/manuverability.

-DP: 14->15
-Shield Radius -> 120

Altagrave:
-Increased DP: 12->14
-Modules no longer consume additional fleet points on deployment

-Added BACK_OFF AI flag to encourage AI altagrave's to back down in certain scenarios. It's not 100% reliable but should improve survivability somewhat. AI gonna AI

-Previouly ship system would absorb up to 2000 points of damage, and when maxing out gauge generate 10 projectiles worth 2.5k damage in total, even if the amount absorbed exceeded the threshold.

-Adjusted system to generate a scaling number of seeker projectiles based off the total amount of damage absorbed, up to 5,000 at 20 projectiles. The default amount generated has been decreased to 8 from 10 to equate to the base threshold of absorbed damage, however.

-added small trail fx to seeker projectiles.

V1.2.3
---------
-Altagrave's built in hullmod is now properly hidden and wont be found as loot

-Attempted to improve AI performance with Altagrave:
	-Generally speaking, Alta is flux hungry, and wont fire main gun after a certain threshold
	-AI cannot perceive that modules are important to its survival, very often eats hits to the side of modules that easily could have been avoided by a player as a result

	-Converted Front Shield to Omni Shield
		-Omni Shield doesnt extend to some parts of the legs, for now this is intentional
	-Increased collision radius 67->100

-cr recovery %/day: 8%->6%

V1.2.2RC2
--------
Nex:

-removed random folder in mission folder

-Super Ship start: Replaced Altagrave and Condor with Altagrave[C] and Wayfarer
	-Differences between the two are mostly superficial, [C] has built-in Op Center and is more suitable as a flag

-Added Ground Support bonus for new fighter wings. Non-cataphract fighters were conferring additional bonus if a single cataphract wing was added, this was fixed.

-Added Juno Mk. III, a modular medium fire support beam cannon. Available on New Meshan, may need further tweaks

Altagrave:
-Standard Altagrave now has very low chance of appearing in scavenger fleets

-Adjusted base variant auto groups

-Karma Seekers: Damage type to Kinetic
	-reverted damage back to 250 from 200

-Altagrave should be less inclined to suicidally charge at things 2x its size or into swarms of enemies, not 100% what caused this issue, may have some relation to weapon loadout

-Added normal maps for gLib support and shadow effect to some turrets/decos

-Limb animation now slightly affected by turning/strafing left or right

-new head sprite for Altagrave[C]

	- Won't do much against heavy hits, but will help mitigate issue with getting papercut to death by fighters

-swapped active flare launcher to Low-Grade EMP Emitter (Same system as Recordbreaker) on backpack module

-Modules now mirror the hullmods applied to the parent ship

-Increased OP of all modules to 1000 to prevent any unintended behavior caused by hullmods that readd themselves in certain scenarios

-Added hullmod describing modules and their effects

-Altagrave[C] would never spawn in markets with modules, is now a seperate hull instead of being skin-based [Used exact same ID for the hull that was used by the skin file, so save compatible; tested and confirmed myself]

Recordbreaker:
Armor: 45->30
HP: 450->400

Valken-X:
-Fixed deco weapon being listed in Armaments

	-Exceeding/reaching max karma generates an explosion that damages anything within 300 su and flings homing projectiles
		-Projectiles will home in on selected target after a few second delay, otherwise random target is chosen
	-Bonus is lost once karma is maxed.

---
v1.1
-------------------
-Added fake_fighter tag to Einhänder, which will resolve some targeting and fuze logic bugs with several THI scripted weapons and how they interact with frigates that setHullSize to fighter via script. (Note to other mods that might do similar things, please add the "fake_fighter" tag to the pertinent vessels in ship_data.csv! credit to MesoTroniK )
-Fixed crash with Einhänder caused by attempting to retreat from the top of the map during 'escape' battles
-Fixed bug that wiped faction blueprints from Tritachyon/Independent fleets
-Adjusted rarity of all fighters so they are less common in NPC fleets
-Added compatibility for some IndEvo features ( i think )

=== Einhänder ===
-Synergy Mount has been axed. It just looks too weird with some combos. I'll probably make an alternate version with mounts replacing some built-ins
-Added built-in drone wing with customizable small hybrid mount as replacement.
-Can equip weapons up to 9OP, but flux reserves might not be enough for it to actually fire them all (I.E) you can actually mount an AM blaster on the drone, but it can't actually fire. I'll add hard restrictions to this later
-Added Phase Field hullmod

- Einhänder has been fully switched to fighter hullsize, outside of a few edge cases. Gameplay wise this means it **should** suffer or benefit from all the same effects that fighters do, including custom ones (so long as that effect checks if a ship is a **fighter** and not checking its **fighter_wing**), including custom ones, and AI will react and evaluate it as as a fighter also. Thanks to MesoTronIk for bringing this to my attention.

-Fighter Doctrine Lv2 bonus now applies to the Einhänder as well

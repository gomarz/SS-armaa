		-Activating autopilot on player-controlled einhander will have it return to carrier if:
			- CR <= 40% or
			- HP <= 50%
			- non-ammo regen weapon exhausted
		- Once landed, 'assigned' the carrier as a mothership and will attempt to return to it in the future
		- Refit restores 20% CR and fully replenishes hp, armor, ammo, and PPT
		- Refit time is proportional to the carrier's replacement rate, with reduced rates increasing refit time
		- Destruction of the carrier will also destroy Einhänder
	-AI use should be much more viable now
	-Autopilot is immediately engaged upon opening Command UI

	- Damage Type: ENERGY-> FRAG
-Shield Radius: 70->360

Altagrave:
-There appears to be a bug with ships that use modules that makes them much more aggressive than they should normally be. This seemingly is fixed in 0.9.5a, but if you want to prevent this behavior from occuring with AItagrave's, destroying their back module with a console command or assigning them a ship to escort resolves the issue.
-For this reason, modules no longer confer any statistical bonus/malus to speed/manuverability.

-Fixed weird interaction with shipsystem and missiles using custom AI
-DP: 14->15
-Shield Radius -> 120
-Seeker Damage 250->150
-HP -> 2500->3000

-Increased Ilorin engagement range to 4k su, speed 110->140, OP->16

Bihänder:
-Increased Juno Mk. II DPS from 400->1.5k


Altagrave:
-Increased DP: 12->14
-Modules no longer consume additional fleet points on deployment

-Added BACK_OFF AI flag to encourage AI altagrave's to back down in certain scenarios. It's not 100% reliable but should improve survivability somewhat. AI gonna AI

-Previouly ship system would absorb up to 2000 points of damage, and when maxing out gauge generate 10 projectiles worth 2.5k damage in total, even if the amount absorbed exceeded the threshold.

-Adjusted system to generate a scaling number of seeker projectiles based off the total amount of damage absorbed, up to 5,000 at 20 projectiles. The default amount generated has been decreased to 8 from 10 to equate to the base threshold of absorbed damage, however.

-added small trail fx to seeker projectiles.

V1.2.3
---------
-Altagrave's built in hullmod is now properly hidden and wont be found as loot

-Attempted to improve AI performance with Altagrave:
	-Generally speaking, Alta is flux hungry, and wont fire main gun after a certain threshold
	-AI cannot perceive that modules are important to its survival, very often eats hits to the side of modules that easily could have been avoided by a player as a result

	-Converted Front Shield to Omni Shield
		-Omni Shield doesnt extend to some parts of the legs, for now this is intentional
	-Increased collision radius 67->100
	-increased shield radius-> 67->90
	-base flux: 5500->5700
	-base dissipation: 350->360 
	-Shield Efficiency: 0.7->0.66
	-Vajra flux/shot: 120->110

-cr recovery %/day: 8%->6%

V1.2.2RC2
--------
Nex:

-removed random folder in mission folder

-Super Ship start: Replaced Altagrave and Condor with Altagrave[C] and Wayfarer
	-Differences between the two are mostly superficial, [C] has built-in Op Center and is more suitable as a flag

-Added Ground Support bonus for new fighter wings. Non-cataphract fighters were conferring additional bonus if a single cataphract wing was added, this was fixed.

-Added Juno Mk. III, a modular medium fire support beam cannon. Available on New Meshan, may need further tweaks

Altagrave:
-Standard Altagrave now has very low chance of appearing in scavenger fleets

-Adjusted base variant auto groups

-Karma Seekers: Damage type to Kinetic
	-reverted damage back to 250 from 200

-Added additional small hybrid mount; increased OP by 5

-Altagrave should be less inclined to suicidally charge at things 2x its size or into swarms of enemies, not 100% what caused this issue, may have some relation to weapon loadout

-Added normal maps for gLib support and shadow effect to some turrets/decos

-Limb animation now slightly affected by turning/strafing left or right

-new head sprite for Altagrave[C]

Vajra:
	-Drastically reduced tracking effect of Vajra, should be much easier to hit smaller ships, both under player and AI control
	-Increased projectile speed: 950->1000

-increased armor on all modules to match parent hull armor: 400->450
	- Won't do much against heavy hits, but will help mitigate issue with getting papercut to death by fighters

-swapped active flare launcher to Low-Grade EMP Emitter (Same system as Recordbreaker) on backpack module

-Modules now mirror the hullmods applied to the parent ship

-Increased OP of all modules to 1000 to prevent any unintended behavior caused by hullmods that readd themselves in certain scenarios

-Added hullmod describing modules and their effects

-Altagrave[C] would never spawn in markets with modules, is now a seperate hull instead of being skin-based [Used exact same ID for the hull that was used by the skin file, so save compatible; tested and confirmed myself]

Recordbreaker:
Armor: 45->30
HP: 450->400

Valken-X:
-Fixed deco weapon being listed in Armaments
-Plasma Blade was set at an ammo of 1, removed ammo limitation

-Altered Juno Mk. II for better visual consistency with other Juno family weapons


V1.2RC2
--------

	-Absorbing projectiles increases "Enlightenment"
	-Enlightenment grants a scaling bonus to Weapon RoF and Flux Cost Reduction as damage absorbed increases, up to 30%
	-Exceeding/reaching max karma generates an explosion that damages anything within 300 su and flings homing projectiles
		-Projectiles will home in on selected target after a few second delay, otherwise random target is chosen
	-Bonus is lost once karma is maxed.

New Mission: Battle of Meshan 1A9
- Survive against waves of redacted

Nexerelin:
-Added start with Altagrave
-Added basic BP to all starts

New Wing: Valken-X - 10 OP

Cataphract Complement:
-Each wing now grants a different ground support bonus:
Valken, Kouto: 4
Bihander: 16
Ilorin: 12

Einhänder:
-Phase Damper Field Time Dilation: 50%->60%
-Phase Damper Field Beam Resistance: 40%->50%
-Beam Coat Beam Resistance: 35%->40%
-Beam Coat tooltip stated total stacking beam resistance was 77% when it was in reality around 60%, corrected to reflect new values. Max resistance is 70%
-With these changes beam heavy enemies and burst PD beams shouldn't be as insurmountable, while remaining a threat
-AS Glaive size: Medium->Small, this will give it a more accurate (and reduced weapon health) HP for its physical size
-Increased texture scroll speed on AS Glaive's trail

---
v1.1
-------------------
-Added fake_fighter tag to Einhänder, which will resolve some targeting and fuze logic bugs with several THI scripted weapons and how they interact with frigates that setHullSize to fighter via script. (Note to other mods that might do similar things, please add the "fake_fighter" tag to the pertinent vessels in ship_data.csv! credit to MesoTroniK )

-Added built-in drone wing with customizable small hybrid mount as replacement.
-Can equip weapons up to 9OP, but flux reserves might not be enough for it to actually fire them all (I.E) you can actually mount an AM blaster on the drone, but it can't actually fire. I'll add hard restrictions to this later
-Added Phase Field hullmod
==-New System-==
-Phase Charge->Offense Mode

------------------------
-Cataphract Complement now grants +4 bonus for every cataphract wing
-Fixed bug where ships without the CARRIER tag would not receive Cataphract Complement hullmod
-Added info on ammo resupply drone for strikecraft hullmod

====================
1.0.5
--------------------
-Any carrier with at least 1 Cataphract wing will now get the hullmod "cataphract complement" that grants small ground support bonus, applied when visiting markets 

=== Einhänder ===
-can start active vent during phase instead of having to exit phase first, and then venting.

- Limited Ammo weapons can be reloaded by returning to carrier, if the weapons max ammo count is at least 2 (no spamming reapers ): )

- Einhänder has been fully switched to fighter hullsize, outside of a few edge cases. Gameplay wise this means it **should** suffer or benefit from all the same effects that fighters do, including custom ones (so long as that effect checks if a ship is a **fighter** and not checking its **fighter_wing**), including custom ones, and AI will react and evaluate it as as a fighter also. Thanks to MesoTronIk for bringing this to my attention.

-Fighter Doctrine Lv2 bonus now applies to the Einhänder as well

=== Valken === 
-Fixed severed Valken arms showing up in markets.

-Replaced Valken's AAF system with new system: GU-14 Firebolt Feeder

When shooting down enemy aircraft, it triggers a complex series of microthermal reactions within the drive's core. These reactions momentarily amplify the mech's flux dissipation capabilities, allowing it to channel and dissipate excess thermal energy with unmatched efficiency. As a result, the mech remains cool under the most intense combat conditions, enabling sustained high-performance operations.",,,

The bulky and cumbersome cousin to ArmaA's Laser Blades, Anti-Ship swords fell out of favor over the formers lightweightedness and ease of use. Despite this, these blades are extremely devastating.  The most important factor behind the design of anti-ship swords is raw power. As Laser Blades have little to no mass, the force of the impact is extremely weak. A standard Laser Blade relies entirely on the intense output of its beam to inflict damage - this is not so with anti-ship swords. With an anti-ship sword, it is tremendous mass that imparts devastating amounts of force onto whatever it impacts.

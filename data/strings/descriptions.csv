armaa_einhander,SHIP,"Exceptionally armed strikecraft with an equally steep logistical profile. While fragile and highly susceptible to point defenses, it's a monstrous weapon in the hands of skilled pilots.

A scrapped concept resurrected via the generous funding of an enigmatic venture capitalist. The original mission profile it was designed for has been lost to time, but records still expound that development proved to be an exhaustive and expensive task - decades of corporate espionage, fatal phase-related incidents, and technological hurdles were endured before the first functional unit rolled off the production lines. 

In its final iteration, the Einhänder came with capabilities matching that of the most advanced strikecraft designs known to exist, thanks in no small part to a irregular phase coil that partially submerges the unit in p-space. This allows it to retain the capability to interact with objects in normal space, granting it combat potential deceptively greater than one would expect.

Unfortunately, the massive costs and logistical requirements for a single strikecraft, no matter how effective, could not be justified to the supervisory board, and LPC production allegedly never commenced. Years later, a number of these were delivered to the ArmaA R&D division located in the Persean Sector prior to the Collapse for undisclosed purposes.

The units that survived the ensuing crises that engulfed the sector are by and large a rarity - some remain in storage, according to official ArmaA Corporation statements, while others became heirlooms passed throughout the generations.",,,

armaa_monitor,SHIP,"Destroyer-grade platform that emphasizes long-range fire support as opposed to head on confrontation. While especially effective against larger, slower targets, low flux capacity and manuverability can lead to it being easily overwhelmed without a covering force to support it.

Some cycles before the First AI War, the discovery of a peculiar machine sparked a new branch in weapons development for the ArmaA corp. The Garegga was born as an evolutionary bridge of sorts between ArmaA's own technological base and the fairly complex one discovered, but many aspects of the vessel could not be replicated. To that end, an even larger design was developed to further iterate upon the concept. A deal was brokered between Ko Combine and ArmaA that granted them access to a number of Monitor-class frigates and limited production rights to several of its key components, which were used as the core for the Watchdog series.",,,

armaa_valkenmp,SHIP,"Generally considered no better than a Talon, the Valken series trades quantity and speed for enhanced offensive capability against larger ships. The greatest caveat to this boon is that they are only somewhat better protected than it's comparate, meaning few pilots live long enough to fully utilize this potential without additional assistance. 

The premiere Cataphract-class design, the Valken won out over its competitor concepts with the rationalization that high-performance strikecraft were wasted on pilots whose average life expectancy could be highballed in minutes. In order to offset the expensive hardware necessary to develop a combat-viable machine that could operate effectively in space and land, sweeping cuts were made in as many aspects as possible, especially anything deemed non-vital to performance. The artificial muscles utilized by the unit enable locomotion via a cost efficient fluid, which coincidentally had the unfortunate characteristic of being highly flammable. In short, a critical strike to the torso generally resulted in an explosion when the internal ammo storage for the built-in mortar was breached, which conveniently rested directly below the cockpit. If by some miracle the pilot survived, they would be summarily cooked alive. 

Despite being objectively inferior to dedicated land or space vehicles in their respective roles, its ability to fill both on demand at a low (economical) impact ensured it had a niche to carve out and enjoy some degree of success. It is the ArmA Corporation's good fortune that this stands even moreso in the grim reality of the Persean Sector post-Collapse, where the value of a human life has seen a steady decline, and the profession of enterprising raider or revolutionary has become commonplace. ",,,
armaa_valkencannon,SHIP,"The successor to the Einhander fulfills the anti-ship niche must like its older brother. Equipped with a Phase Dampening Field, its signature weapon is the shoulder-mounted Juno Mk. II beam cannon. While extremely potent, the main cannon takes time to charge and can only be fired a few times without comprimising structural integrity. These offensive capabilites are rounded out with a miniature railgun and an all-range homing beam attack. Capable of engaging enemy strikecraft, but it is not recommended.

Despite the high performance of the Einhander, shareholders of ArmaA quickly pointed out the exorbitant cost to simply field one. To that end, the Bihander was created as an effort to create a more economical version of its older brother. The internal frame is almost identical,  but expensive components were generally replaced with cheaper alternatives. The exception to this is the Juno Mk. II, a perfected and far more destructive version of the Einhander's main weapon.

The improved GTV-9A �Juno� system was significantly scaled down from its ultimate operational role in order to collect live data for use in improving the system prior to naval adoption.",,,
armaa_kouto,SHIP,"The suit of armor for modern-day knights of the Sector, the Kouto's primary role is to draw fire while applying unrelenting pressure on enemy targets via dual SCTR-20 Miniguns. Less than ideal manuverability and ineffectiveness against armored targets has given it somewhat of a bad reputation among pilots.

Conceived as the cutting edge showcase of the Land-Space Cataphract concept, the Kouto boasted a bevy of high-performance (and expensive) features, such as the implementation of revolutionarily compact yet powerful artificial muscles and a hybrid neurophysical piloting interface that allowed it to execute extremely precise maneuvers. Unfortunately, the development of the Kouto came about during a schism in the supervisory board; one side doggedly insistent on creating the most advanced and flashy hardware possible, while the other eschewed the importance of an cheap, easy to maintain, and comparatively effective platform - a debate that the champions of the Kouto ended up losing. The partially completed design was shelved in favor of the development of its far cheaper cousin, the Valken. Following an internal power struggle that saw company priorities shift once more, a retrofitted version of this unit was put into service. 

ArmaA Corp found that while the extremely efficient shield generator affords great survivability, it also lent the expectation for Kouto pilots to lead attacks on enemy targets and ironically lent to a higher pilot mortality rate.",,,
armaa_ilorin,SHIP,"Heavily armed and armored, these ponderous monstrosities are barely capable of defending themselves from fast targets or even striking them; their ordinance barrages become downright lethal should they manage to close the distance with their prey, however.

Created in a bygone era, some speculate the Ilorin as one of the ArmaA Corporations oldest designs due to its sheer simplicity and brutal effectiveness. Bristling with weapons and protected with thick armor, the iron shell of the Ilorin made it a popular frontline unit and favourite of anti-rebellion units, snugly fitting into the combat doctrine at the time.

Barely space-worthy, extra verniers installed alongside the units antiquated jumpjets were intended only for brief use during deployments to breach carrier decks. To that end, they manuever through the vacuum with the grace of a bull passing through a china shop: Ilorin pilots are heavily discouraged from straying too far from their parent ship and instead specialize in striking large, easy to hit targets and lending support during planetary operations.",,,
armaa_bit,SHIP,"Customizable gunpods capable of omnidirectional, high-speed attacks. While primarily operated autonomously, the Einhander's secondary pilot can also freely direct them. The majority of the frame is reserved for housing installed weaponry and propulsion systems - as a result, despite being capable of bringing a tremendous amount of firepower to bear, they are mired by limited operational range and durability.",,,

armaa_altagrave,SHIP,"What this design lacks in weapon slot quantity is made up for via versatility; At its heart lies the KARMA system which posseses a variety of applications on the battlespace. Additional modular components grant impressive agility and speed, but are vulnerable to small strikecraft and flanking attacks. 

Created during the First AI War at a period where the local ArmaA branch was considered to be at the peak of its power, this design can be partially attributed to reverse-engineered, borrowed, and outright stolen technologies of various origin. R&D of the accumulated tech base resulted in creation of the Kinetic Automated Range Missile Assimilator. With the aid of a delta-level AI, KARMA autonomously tags and identifies dangerous projectiles, intercepts them, and stores the acquired kinetic energy for later use. In the case of guided missiles, malicious code is injected that spoofs IFFs and renders the original signal unrecognizable, effectively hijacking them. This allows an Altagrave to screen ships against particularly thick hails of ordinance in a pinch, among other things. 

While adopting fighting tactics more akin to a spaceship, operationally they behave more like oversized and overengineered strikecraft. Hardly any space is spared for cargo capacity or personnel to squeeze out maximum combat effectiveness, and assigned staff are generally ferried to the vessel prior to combat operations - lacking many basic amenities provided on true starships - while an enhanced derivative of the neural interface used by late-gen Cataphracts enables the vessel to be controlled by a single pilot at nearly a 1:1 ratio (albeit with the aid of neuro-linked support staff, whose sole function is to serve as extra computing power). While a lone pilot could theoretically operate an Altagrave without support staff, the resulting strain would leave them with bits of brain leaking out of their ears... and that's a generous assumption.",,,

armaa_altagrave_ex,SHIP,"The core of this aged machine is clearly an Altagrave-class, but detailed scans detect part of automated vessels in its superstructure. This casts an uncertainty on its point of origin: these automated components definitely aren't legal due to potential threat of delta+ AI possession, yet this vessel still contains human interface, control consoles and even cramped crew quarters. Perhaps this specimen was once captured by someone or something during the span of the First AI War and then was refurbished to different spec?

Truth may have been lost in  the annals of time, but what can't be disputed is its efficiency - it outperforms other mobile armors that are part of Altagrave series to this day.",,,
armaa_valkenx,SHIP,"Enhanced model of the Valken introduced in the late Expansion era, the Valken eXpansion-type possesses generally improved performance and staying power over its progenitor, swapping out the chest mounted mortar with an ion Cannon. A high-intensity Plasma Blade built into the forearm ensures these Cataphracts remain a cut above the rest in close quarters combat, but not as easy to maintain and replace.",,,

armaa_aleste,SHIP,"Exceptional durability combined with a diverse loadout. The arm-mounted Stake Driver is effective against stripped hull - however, these spikes also detonate shortly after embedding themselves within a ship, creating a localized magnetic field that plays havoc with all manner of electronics. These capabilities are rounded out by two CLAW bits, flimsy yet nimble drones that serve as effective threat multipliers.

The first (perhaps only) Post-Collapse Land-Space design, the Aleste is a direct descendent of the Einhander that embodies the 'quality over quantity' ethos eschewed by its predecessor while remaining mindful of affordability. The decision to revisit a line of high-performance specifications arose moreso out of desperation than need during the First AI War, as the warfront situation progressively worsened. The omission of complex and alien phase components allowed significantly greater modularity, and as a result two different versions of the craft were produced - one equipped with autonomous drones for additional anti-fighter capability, and another capable of mounting additional weaponry. for anti-ship purposes.",,,

armaa_gallant,SHIP,"Slow and unwieldy strikecraft fitted with a Juno Mk. III beam cannon. Can overwhelms shields and vaporize hull, but are effectively helpless while firing. Best utilized in combination with other bombers, where it can soften shields prior to their strike.",,,

armaa_hazard_frig,SHIP,"These craft sacrifice durability for ludicrous manuverability and greater firepower. Effective in small skirmishes and harassing ships, G-Hazard's also come equipped with additional software that allows them to command a small Cataphract Lance, making them cheap and disposable support units.

Clearly a Valken derivative, their designation was altered to reduce consumer confusion, although the official name has since been lost to time. It has been stated that the equipment and weaponry used by the G-Hazard ended up being more expensive than the Cataphract itself, and certainly its pilot - the story goes that assignments to one during the First AI War was often seen as a marginally more hopeful death sentence than to a Valken or Talon, as pilots frequently met their end in the cockpit due to the immense pressures exerted on their fragile bodies during combat. This was mostly alleviated with the introduction of powerful inertial negators and a padded harness, but the 'endearing' nickname of Hazard stuck.",,,

armaa_xyphos,SHIP,"Upgraded with enhanced sensors and targetting software, this alteration of the Xyphos is able to operate independently (albeit briefly) and has been modified to carry an Ion Pulser for greater offensive power. Eequipped with additional software that allows the pilot to properly coordinate an additional Xyphos wing, making them effective support units.

The design for these Xyphos were developed using captured craft from Tri-Tachyon during the First AI War, and altered with a red paintjob to be easily distinguishable. For one reason or another, they were never pushed into LPC production like most fighter chassis - despite this, they serve as adequate support units for a fleet with no better alternatives, and their ability to rapidly render vessels helpless and adrift in space - provided they are not obliterated first - have garnered them significant use by the more unscrupulous powers in the sector.

armaa_leynos_frig,SHIP,"Thick armor rivaling that of smaller frigates and larger housing for additional equipment sees the Leynos often serving as wing leader for small strikecraft squadrons. Lacking a shield generator, it relies on an integrated Damper Field and it's wingmen to see it through the flames of battle.

armaa_garegga_tt,SHIP,"When Tri-Tachyon eliminated ArmaA's security forces during the Battle of Meshan in cycle 94, they seized the majority of the corporations infrastructure and most of their assets. These revamped RA-96 were christened 'Tri-hander', a play on the companies moniker and the infamous Einhander. While not a mainstay of their navy by any means, these units served alongside other refurbished vessels following the First AI War when the corporation was still in disarray.",,,
armaa_garegga,SHIP,"The RA-96 GAREGGA stands first-class amongst craft that excel in close-quarters combat. Dual G-1001 assault weapons capable of decimating entire strikecraft formations and pounding larger ships into scrap are only hindered by their meagre engagement range.

Following the uneasy tension that befell the Sector following the events of Mairaath, the Garegga represented a shift in ArmaA priorities as the corporation was spurred into developing larger and more powerful machines to supplement their embryonic navy. Derived as a testbed for adapting technology behind cataphract-type mechs to a platform optimized for space combat, the Garegga is significantly larger to accomodate a greater power core and ship-grade weaponry, but lacks any ground combat capability. 

The combination neural and targeting interface SILVERSWORD establishes a raw, semi-invasive connection between the pilots brain and an AI core adjunct to the machine itself, and safety limiters can be disabled in order to bring out its maximum potential. Sadly, sustained use resulted in catastrophic brain injury in 96.875% of all trial runs as the human component's mental bandwith was overwhelmed by the exponentially increasing information load fed into it. It was for this reason that an additional emergency stop circuit was introduced shortly thereafter, which automatically halts the system, violently shunting excess flux into the void.

While the weapon takes far longer to charge and cannot fire as rapidly, the effects are significantly more devastating and can pierce strained shield generators.

In the past, this weapon was actually the standard-issue head unit for Garegga. Their usefulness and effectiveness saw them revised into the modular form seen today.",,,
armaa_energysurge,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Increases manuverability and activates secondary firing mode of the main weapon at the expense of increased recoil, and decreased rate of fire. All energy damage increases as flux does.",,,
armaa_mb,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity.",Movement,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity.",,,
armaa_amalgamatefeed,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Increases Weapon RoF, Speed, and Manuverability of the host ship and fighters while reducing weapon flux cost based on what percentage of the wing is alive.",,,
armaa_siegeMode,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Halves top speed and turn rate, while increasing weapon range by the same level, and increasing shield efficiency.",,,
armaa_plasmaJets,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Grants an tremendous speed boost in the given direction briefly.",,,

armaa_mpdamper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Speeds up timeflow by 30%, reduces damage by 20%.",,,
armaa_overshield,SHIP_SYSTEM,Shields absorb 5x damage. Disables weapons.,,,
armaa_karma,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Projectiles within 600 SU are absorbed on activation, Hostile tracking missiles that can be hacked will target enemies. On standard Altagrave models, absorbed projectiles grant a scaling weapon RoF/Flux reduction up to 30%, while the [C]ommand variant grants a scaling time dilation bonus up to 15% for all friendlies within 1000 of the unit.",,,
armaa_lowgradeemp,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates a weak EMP generator. Nearby missiles, fighters, weapon emplacements and engines of enemy ships are all targeted.",,,
armaa_oboost,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Dramatically increases speed, and moderately increases manuverability for one second. ",,,
armaa_claw,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Autonomous hunter-killer drones that frequently sheathe themselves in lesser temporal shells for higher performance. Two can be launched simultaneously, and carries 6 in total.",,,
armaa_silverSword,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Increases speed, acceleration, energy and ballistic rate of fire, as well as flux dissipation and capacity while reducing weapon range past 450 units and doubling CR degradation. Exceeding the time limit will overload the ship and generate an explosion damaging anything within its radius, rendering it vulnerable - however, the effects of this system are greatly magnified as the limit is approached.",,,

armaa_homeworld,CUSTOM,"A formerly unremarkable planet, it's fortune reversed when Arma Armatura received rights to the planet via corporate charter following the Second AI War. 

The colony has enjoyed rapid growth, housing one of the most well-trained conglomoration of independent mercenaries and fortune seekers in the region. ArmaA has apparently left the population to self-govern for the most part, and New Meshan is outwardly a constitutional monarchy. Those ""in the know"", however, maintain that the supervisory board covertly calls the shots.",,,

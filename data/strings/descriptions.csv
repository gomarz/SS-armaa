armaa_einhander,SHIP,"The Einhänder is an exceptionally armed strikecraft with a high logistical profile that harnesses the power of phase technology. In the hands of skilled pilots, it becomes a monstrous weapon.

Originally a scrapped concept, the Einhänder was brought back to life through the generous funding of an enigmatic venture capitalist. Although the original mission profile is now lost, historical records reveal the exhaustive and costly development process. Decades of corporate espionage, fatal phase-related incidents, and technological hurdles were overcome before the first functional unit was successfully produced.

In its final iteration, the Einhänder emerged with capabilities on par with the most advanced strikecraft designs known to exist. Notably, it stands as one of the smallest phase-capable vessels in existence.

Unfortunately, despite its impressive capabilities, the massive costs and logistical requirements of the Einhänder dissuaded the supervisory board from authorizing full production. Consequently, it is believed that the Einhänder never entered widespread manufacturing. However, a select number of units were delivered to ArmaA's R&D division in the Persean Sector prior to the Collapse, their purpose remaining undisclosed. The distinct divergence of this design from other Cataphracts has sparked numerous inquiries, but ArmaA has remained reticent, providing little clarity.

Today, surviving Einhänders are exceedingly rare. Some are said to be held in storage, according to official ArmaA Corporation statements, while others have become cherished heirlooms passed down through generations, their enigmatic history continuing to captivate minds.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
armaa_einhander_plus,SHIP,"Exceptionally armed strikecraft with an equally steep logistical profile. A monstrous weapon in the hands of skilled pilots.

The Einhänder Plus is a mecha created by refurbishing and repairing the original Einhänder using Cataphract parts that are easier to find. Although not explicitly superior to the original, it has the advantage of being able to field a wider variety of weapons and addons due to the free space granted from the removal of the originals experimental weaponry.

While the Plus has a slower speed, reduced durability, and less raw power compared to the Einhänder, its potential to match and even surpass the performance of the original can be realized with proper equipment. The Einhänder Plus has become a favorite among pilots who value versatility and customization in their mecha, despite its rarity due to the difficulty in acquiring and retrofitting the necessary parts.",,,,,

armaa_monitor,SHIP,"The Watchdog emphasizes long-range fire support as opposed to head-on confrontation. While especially effective against larger targets, poor shield emitters and maneuverability can lead to it being easily overwhelmed without a covering force to protect it.

Some cycles before the First AI War, corp tech miners recovered databanks from a red-eyed vessel called a ""Mobile Armor."" Keen on replicating some aspects of this technology, particularly the advanced neural interface, the GAREGGA was rolled out as an initial effort to replicate the technology at a larger scale. Unfortunately, dwindling resources and technical know-how in the sector made further development of the SILVERSWORD system a herculean task, especially without the aid of AI, banned under Domain laws, now even more stringently enforced by the Hegemony.

Instead, two larger designs were developed to further iterate upon the concept. A deal was brokered between the Ko Combine and ArmaA that granted them access to a number of Monitor-class frigates and limited production rights to several of its key components, which were used as the core for the Watchdog series. Beneath the additional armor plating and hulking, servo-assisted arms, grizzled spacers can likely spot some - mostly aesthetic - similarities between the two, but the final product has diverged greatly from its ancestor.

Unlike most ArmaA designs, this vessel lacks any kind of neural control interface, and is thus one of the rare few capable of hosting full crew accommodations, as well as meaningful cargo capacity.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
armaa_valkenmp,SHIP,"The Valken series, while sacrificing quantity and speed, offers greater offensive capability against larger ships compared to its counterpart, the Talon. However, the tradeoff for this boon is that the Valken is only marginally better protected, resulting in few pilots surviving long enough to fully utilize its potential without additional support.

Despite being considered no better than a Talon, the Valken series became the premiere Cataphract-class design due to the rationalization that high-performance strikecraft were unnecessary for pilots with a short life expectancy. To offset the expensive hardware required to develop a combat-viable machine capable of operating in space and on land, significant cuts were made in various aspects deemed non-vital to performance. The unit's artificial muscles utilize a cost-efficient fluid for locomotion, which also happens to be highly flammable. In the event of a critical strike to the torso, the internal ammo storage for the built-in mortar could be breached, resulting in an explosion directly below the cockpit, potentially killing the pilot.

Despite being objectively inferior to dedicated land or space vehicles in their respective roles, the Valken's ability to serve in both capacities with minimal economic impact allowed it to carve out a niche and achieve some success. ArmA Corporation was fortunate that this niche was even more valuable in the grim reality of the Persean Sector post-Collapse, where human life had decreased in value and the roles of raiders and revolutionaries had become commonplace.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
armaa_valken_black,SHIP,"A variant of the Valken featuring a reinforced frame and higher mobility. The blows from its archaiac melee weapon are fierce enough to stress shield generators, but its overall firepower is still inferior to the original. 

The premiere Cataphract-class design, the Valken won out over its competitor concepts with the rationalization that high-performance strikecraft were wasted on pilots whose average life expectancy could be highballed in minutes. In order to offset the expensive hardware necessary to develop a combat-viable machine that could operate effectively in space and land, sweeping cuts were made in as many aspects as possible, especially anything deemed non-vital to performance. The artificial muscles utilized by the unit enable locomotion via a cost efficient fluid, which coincidentally had the unfortunate characteristic of being highly flammable. In short, a critical strike to the torso generally resulted in an explosion when the internal ammo storage for the built-in mortar was breached, which conveniently rested directly below the cockpit. If by some miracle the pilot survived, they would be summarily cooked alive. 

Despite being objectively inferior to dedicated land or space vehicles in their respective roles, its ability to fill both on demand at a low (economical) impact ensured it had a niche to carve out and enjoy some degree of success. It is the ArmA Corporation's good fortune that this stands even moreso in the grim reality of the Persean Sector post-Collapse, where the value of a human life has seen a steady decline, and the profession of enterprising raider or revolutionary has become commonplace.

armaa_kouto,SHIP,"The Kouto is primarily used as a screening unit to protect friendly forces against missiles and lesser strikecraft, while also relentlessly pressuring enemy shields with its kinetic energy bazooka and accompanying SCTR-20 Minigun. However, its lackluster maneuverability and ineffectiveness against heavily armored targets have caused it to be regarded unfavorably by many pilots.

Initially envisioned as the pinnacle of the Land-Space Cataphract concept, the Kouto was designed with a multitude of high-performance and costly features, including compact yet powerful artificial muscles and a hybrid neurophysical piloting interface that allowed for exceptional precision in maneuvers. Unfortunately, its development was mired in a conflict between two factions of the supervisory board - one advocating for the creation of the most advanced and flashy hardware possible, while the other sought a cheaper, more practical platform that would be easier to maintain and still effective in combat. The latter faction eventually won out, and the partially completed Kouto design was shelved in favor of the development of the more affordable Valken. However, after an internal power struggle shifted company priorities once again, a retrofitted version of the Kouto was eventually put into service.",,,,,

This discovery raises questions about its origin: the inclusion of these automated elements is clearly illegal due to the potential threat of delta+ AI possession. Nevertheless, this vessel still boasts human interfaces, control consoles, and even cramped crew quarters. Could it be that this specimen was once seized by an entity or entity during the tumultuous era of the First AI War and subsequently retrofitted to a different specification?

armaa_prodromos,SHIP,"This suit excels in intercepting fighter formations and missiles but is vulnerable to most space-grade weapons. While it is more durable than conventional infantry, its effectiveness is balanced against the minimal loss of pilots, distinguishing it from its closest comparison, the Wasp.

Arma Armatura considers the Prodromos-class battle armor as one of their greatest creations. As a missing link between power armor-clad infantry and full-scale mechs, the executives envisioned the design to revolutionize traditional strategic marine applications. Soldiers could easily deploy from friendly ships for independent ""breach and board"" operations, eliminating the risk of losing boarding ships to an errant boardee's decision to scuttle their vessel. However, these ambitions were never realized as even the Talon, a lowly model, offers better protection than these hardsuits. Combat drones have also proven to be more suitable for land battles, rendering the Prodromos-class obsolete.

The genesis of the Bakraid traces back to a strategic initiative aimed at overcoming the constraints of conventional Cataphracts, which heavily depend on carrier support and lack a travel drive, restricting their viability for extended operations such as longe range patrols. This design came about after some engineers gutted a salvaged Garegga unit and integrated a Cataphract-sized docking clamp in the gaping hole that remained. The limbs were removed in favor of additional missile hardpoints, while crew space and storage were strategically optimized. This transformation not only provided the newly named Bakraid with extended operational endurance but also granted it the autonomy to function independently for prolonged durations. The outcome was a state-of-the-art mobile armor capable of undertaking long-range missions with the added capability to eject the close quarters phase-capable unit as the situation required.

armaarmatura_pirates,FACTION,"The Meshan Reprisal Coalition (MRC) is the evolution of an initially peaceful political movement aimed to hold accountable those responsible for the catastrophic misuse of Domain-era planetkillers throughout the AI Wars. However, over time, the organization took a dark turn, evolving into a radicalized paramilitary organization that operates on the fringes of civilized space today. Their motivations have become morally ambiguous, to say the least.

The MRC maintains loose affiliations with a spectrum of factions; all of whom claim to champion 'noble' causes, such as the ARC. This ambiguous nobility often pits them against the established powers in the Sector, though they hold particular ire towards Tri-Tachyon, the Hegemony, and the Sindrian Diktat. 

Persistent rumors suggest that influential figures in the landscape tacitly endorse the MRC's actions and have been subtly employing them as a sort of proxy to satisfy their own interests. This theory is supported by the steady decrease in any kind of tangible demands for justice and a ramp up in raids and attacks in recent years.

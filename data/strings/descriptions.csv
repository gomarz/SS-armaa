armaa_einhander,SHIP,"An exceptionally armed, phase-capable strikecraft with a punishing logistical profile, the Einhänder is both a marvel of Pre-Collapse engineering and a cautionary tale in cost-versus-combat viability. In the hands of a capable pilot, it becomes a devastating precision weapon. In the hands of anyone else, a liability best kept in the hangar.

Initially a discarded black project with no clear mission profile, the Einhänder was resurrected through the considerable backing of a mysterious private financier. Surviving records outline an arduous development cycle marked by corporate espionage, internal sabotage, and multiple fatal phase-interface failures. Even after decades of iteration, the design was considered too volatile, too specialized—until it wasn't.

Its final form was a breakthrough. Compact, aggressively modular, and unnaturally fast, the Einhänder remains one of the smallest phase-capable vessels ever constructed. Though full production was never approved—its costs far outstripping its deployment utility—a limited run was produced and shipped to Arma Armatura's high-clearance R&D assets in the Persean Sector shortly before the Collapse. Their exact purpose remains classified.

What is known is this: the Einhänder did not vanish. While few functional units survive, its influence did. Many modern Cataphract designs trace core elements—reactive armor configurations, modular targeting matrices, even the foundational S-II skeletal frame—directly to breakthroughs pioneered by the Einhänder program. It is, in many respects, the ancestor of an entire design philosophy: one that prioritizes adaptability, technical overreach, and battlefield dominance over simplicity or scale.

Today, intact Einhänder frames are exceedingly rare. Some are locked away in cold storage under corporate seal, while others persist as personal command craft or heirloom prototypes, handed down by those who knew just enough not to discard them. Whether by reverence or regret, the name endures.",,,,,

armaa_einhander_plus,SHIP,"Exceptionally armed strikecraft with an equally steep logistical profile. A monstrous weapon in the hands of skilled pilots.

The Einhänder Plus is a mecha created by refurbishing and repairing the original Einhänder using Cataphract parts that are easier to find. Although not explicitly superior to the original, it has the advantage of being able to field a wider variety of weapons and addons due to the free space granted from the removal of the originals experimental weaponry.

While the Plus has a slower speed, reduced durability, and less raw power compared to the Einhänder, its potential to match and even surpass the performance of the original can be realized with proper equipment. The Einhänder Plus has become a favorite among pilots who value versatility and customization in their mecha, despite its rarity due to the difficulty in acquiring and retrofitting the necessary parts.",,,,,

armaa_monitor,SHIP,"The Watchdog emphasizes long-range fire support as opposed to head-on confrontation. While especially effective against larger targets, poor shield emitters and maneuverability can lead to it being easily overwhelmed without a covering force to protect it.

Some cycles before the First AI War, corp tech miners recovered databanks from a red-eyed vessel called a ""Mobile Armor."" Keen on replicating some aspects of this technology, particularly the advanced neural interface, the GAREGGA was rolled out as an initial effort to replicate the technology at a larger scale. Unfortunately, dwindling resources and technical know-how in the sector made further development of the SILVERSWORD system a herculean task, especially without the aid of AI, banned under Domain laws, now even more stringently enforced by the Hegemony.

Instead, two larger designs were developed to further iterate upon the concept. A deal was brokered between the Ko Combine and ArmaA that granted them access to a number of Monitor-class frigates and limited production rights to several of its key components, which were used as the core for the Watchdog series. Beneath the additional armor plating and hulking, servo-assisted arms, grizzled spacers can likely spot some - mostly aesthetic - similarities between the two, but the final product has diverged greatly from its ancestor.

Unlike most ArmaA designs, this vessel lacks any kind of neural control interface, and is thus one of the rare few capable of hosting full crew accommodations, as well as meaningful cargo capacity.",,,,,

armaa_valkenmp,SHIP,"One of the oldest Cataphract-class frames still in active use, the Valken dates back to the earliest attempts at humanoid strikecraft integration. By modern standards, it is lightly armed, poorly protected, and only marginally more durable than the Talon—the benchmark for expendable aerospace fighters. Its firepower is serviceable, but limited, and few pilots survive long enough to capitalize on its potential without substantial external support.

Originally developed as a proof-of-concept for multi-environment warfare, the Valken was never meant to challenge dedicated aerospace or terrestrial vehicles. However, spiraling production costs and resource scarcity ensured its continued deployment well beyond its intended operational window. Its artificial musculature, powered by an inexpensive high-compression fluid, enables rapid acceleration and precise ground mobility—but the compound is highly flammable. A direct hit to the torso risks chain-reactive ignition, and its torso-mounted micromissile reservoir sits just below the cockpit, compounding the hazard.

Nevertheless, the Valken persisted. Its affordability and modular construction made it a staple of cash-strapped garrisons and desperate planetary militias. Arma Armatura, facing internal budget cuts and high pilot attrition rates, saw little incentive to equip short-lived personnel with high-performance hardware. Features deemed ""non-essential""—ranging from shielding subsystems to redundant life support—were stripped to lower manufacturing costs.

In the post-Collapse chaos of the Persean Sector, where wars outlast generations and pilots are a renewable resource, even a brittle, outdated frame like the Valken can still find a place—if only as something to die in.",,,,,

armaa_valken_black,SHIP,"A field-modified variant of the standard Valken frame, the C-Type trades structural stability for increased mobility and enhanced offensive capability. Outfitted with heavier weapons and an archaic melee implement of considerable mass, it is capable of delivering strikes powerful enough to destabilize shield emitters and overload lighter defensive systems.

Though improvised in nature, the C-Type's performance often exceeds that of the original production model—if only in the hands of pilots aggressive enough to exploit its strengths before its flaws catch up to them.",,,,,

armaa_valkencannon,SHIP,Shouldn't be obtainable.,,,,,
armaa_valkyrie,SHIP,"ArmaA R&D revamped older Valkyrie-class ships to accommodate the deployment of their mechanized assets during terrestrial raids. This variant, while still not potent on its own, trades some cargo space for expanded facilities to support the launch and retrieval of ArmaA's mechanized battle armors, along with a contingent of larger Aleste-class 'mechs it now transports into battle.

As an atmosphere-capable ship, the Valkyrie is now often used to deploy heavy infantry support for tech raids on decivilized worlds.

The ability to deliver large amounts of troops directly to ground targets prompted the Hegemony bureaucrats to designate the hull as ""restricted"" for sale to third parties. Naturally, news of the restriction made it to the general public cycles before it came into effect, launching ill-fated speculation in the future prices of this class. Thus, overproduction and the hull's limited options made the speculator's activities bets largely moot, the only net result is that now, due to oversupply, it is just as easy to obtain a Valkyrie ship as before news of the Hegemony ban ever became public.",,,,,

armaa_kouto,SHIP,"Primarily deployed as a screening unit, the Kouto excels at intercepting missiles and harassing lighter strikecraft. Its armament—a high-velocity kinetic bazooka paired with the SCTR-20 Minigun—allows it to maintain sustained pressure on enemy shields. However, its limited agility and poor performance against heavily armored targets have led many pilots to regard it as a liability outside of its intended role.

Originally conceived as the apex of the Land-Space Cataphract initiative, the Kouto was to feature an array of premium components: dense, high-output artificial musculature, and a cutting-edge hybrid neurophysical control interface designed for seamless pilot integration. On paper, it promised unmatched precision and adaptability.

In practice, it became a battleground for internal politics. One faction of Arma Armatura's supervisory board pushed for maximalist innovation—regardless of cost—while the other lobbied for a more economical, sustainable design. The latter prevailed, shelving the partially realized Kouto in favor of what would eventually become the Valken.

Years later, a shift in corporate leadership revived interest in the Kouto platform, though in a heavily modified and economically constrained form. What emerged bore little resemblance to the original vision: stripped-down, rebalanced, and rushed into deployment. While never the pinnacle it was intended to be, the Kouto found a role as a second-line interceptor-effective enough in its niche, provided its operators accepted its limitations.

armaa_altagrave,SHIP,"What this design lacks in weapon slot quantity is made up for via versatility; At its heart lies the KARMA system which posseses a variety of applications on the battlespace. Additional modular components grant impressive agility and speed, but are vulnerable to small strikecraft and flanking attacks. 

Created during the First AI War at a period where the local ArmaA branch was considered to be at the peak of its power, this design can be partially attributed to reverse-engineered, borrowed, and outright stolen technologies of various origin. R&D of the accumulated tech base resulted in creation of the Kinetic Automated Range Missile Assimilator. With the aid of a delta-level AI, KARMA autonomously tags and identifies dangerous projectiles, intercepts them, and stores the acquired kinetic energy for later use.

This allows an Altagrave to screen ships against particularly thick hails of ordinance in a pinch, among other things. 

While adopting fighting tactics more akin to a spaceship, operationally they behave more like oversized and overengineered strikecraft. Hardly any space is spared for cargo capacity or personnel to squeeze out maximum combat effectiveness, and assigned staff are generally ferried to the vessel prior to combat operations - lacking many basic amenities provided on true starships - An enhanced derivative of the neural interface used by late-gen Cataphracts enables the vessel to be controlled by a single pilot at nearly a 1:1 ratio (albeit with the aid of neuro-linked support staff, whose sole function is to serve as extra computing power).

armaa_altagrave_ex,SHIP,"The heart of this ancient machine undeniably belongs to the Altagrave-class, but upon closer examination, detailed scans reveal traces of automated components integrated into its superstructure. This discovery raises questions about its origin: the inclusion of these automated elements is clearly illegal due to the potential threat of delta+ AI possession. Nevertheless, this vessel still boasts human interfaces, control consoles, and even cramped crew quarters. Could it be that this specimen was once seized by an entity or entity during the tumultuous era of the First AI War and subsequently retrofitted to a different specification?

The truth may have faded into the annals of time, but one fact remains indisputable—its performance is unparalleled. Even today, it outmatches other mobile armors within the Altagrave series.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
armaa_valkenx,SHIP,"A successor to the original Valken frame, the Valken X—officially designated the Valken II eXpansion Type—was a bold attempt to solve its predecessor's well-documented shortcomings. Outfitted with a close-quarters loadout consisting of a rapid-fire chaingun and a short-range energy blade, the frame excels in tight engagements, tearing through armor and disabling subsystems with ruthless efficiency. However, its effectiveness against shielded opponents or optical-range weaponry remains limited.

Developed during the late Expansion Era of the Domain, the Valken X represented a significant leap in Cataphract design. Its reinforced chassis featured armor and plating nearly three times the density of the original Valken, dramatically improving survivability without discarding the platform's core maneuverability. Advances in synthetic musculature and thruster architecture allowed the X-type to retain high mobility across both planetary and zero-G theaters—an uncommon feat for units of its mass profile.

Its most notable feature, the beam-forged ""laser blade,"" was considered cutting-edge at the time—a high-intensity close combat weapon capable of bypassing traditional armor with focused thermal damage. While the concept was viewed with skepticism during development, operational data quickly validated the design: the Valken X was brutally effective at knife-fighting distances. Combined with a compact chaingun designed for suppressive fire and joint disabling shots, the frame could operate independently in confined environments, ship interiors, or dense urban terrain.

Despite these improvements, the Valken X never achieved widespread deployment. Elevated production costs and a high-maintenance burden restricted the frame to elite detachments and limited procurement cycles. Even so, its design philosophies would ripple outward, influencing a generation of Cataphracts to follow. Hangar compatibility—initially a major obstacle—was eventually resolved, making limited Valken X deployment viable well into the post-Collapse era for factions with the resources to maintain them.",,,,,

armaa_valkenx_frig,SHIP,"A formidable Cataphract with decent striking power and commendable agility, the VX Custom is an ideal choice for interception and attack roles as it effortlessly evades incoming attacks.

Originally designed explicitly for elite pilots who failed to qualify for the esteemed Aleste unit, the Valken X Custom Type, also known as VX Custom, represents a substantial advancement from the standard unit. It effectively closes the performance gap between first and second-generation Cataphract models; the power core three times as powerful, while its frame incorporates a robust yet adaptable internal skeleton that emphasizes versatility and resilience to endure the demanding conditions of space and land combat.",,,,,

armaa_caymon,SHIP,"Incorporating the Heron's speed and mobility, the Caymon refits the vessel's bow with a cutting-edge launch module capable of deploying swarms of automated boarding pods. These pods, equipped with advanced breaching tools and reinforced for atmospheric entry, are designed to overwhelm enemy ships, neutralize defenses, and seize critical systems. While it lacks the full complement of strikecraft of its progenitor, the Caymon compensates with its ability to cripple enemy vessels from within.",,,,,

armaa_aleste,SHIP,"The Aleste is an elite class of Cataphract mecha that excels in both durability and versatility. Its combat abilities are further enhanced by the deployment of two Jinete drones, which serve as nimble force multipliers.

As the first known Land-Space design after the Collapse, the Aleste is a direct descendant of the Einhander. It embodies a ""quality over quantity"" approach while still being cost-effective. The decision to revive this line of high-performance specifications arose from the desperate situation during the First AI War, where the frontlines were deteriorating rapidly. By avoiding the use of complex and alien phase components, the Aleste became highly modular. Two different versions were produced, one equipped with autonomous drones for additional anti-fighter capabilities, and another capable of mounting extra weapons for anti-ship purposes.",,,,,

armaa_hazard_frig,SHIP,"Gunhazard sacrifices durability for ludicrous maneuverability and greater firepower. Extremely effective in small skirmishes and at harassing spaceships, G-Hazard comes with command suite, that allows its pilot to command a small Cataphract Lance, making it a cheap and disposable support unit in middle of combat.

Gunhazard is a Valken derivative with different designation in order to reduce potential consumer confusion, though its original designation was lost to time. It has been stated in the documentation that while chassis itself is not particularly expensive, its weaponry and command suite make more than half of unit's cost. Its current 'endearing' designation has been crafted during the chaos of First AI War. Assignments to this Cataphract were seen as marginally better compared to Talon or Valken wings. Unlucky G-Hazard pilots often met their end not from hands of enemy, but due to extreme pressure and gravitational forces exerted on their bodies during combat. This was mostly alleviated with the introduction of inertia dampeners as well as padded harness.",,,,,
armaa_hazard,SHIP,"A hardy mining mech re-repurposed for the realities of the Sector. Can provide some fire support, but more daring applications are available - it's piledriver can devastate unshielded ships if -and only if- they reach them, which is a task in and of itself.

One of the earliest creations of Arma Armatura, the Gunhed was initially deployed as a military asset in the formative years of mechanized warfare. Designed for durability rather than versatility, it eschewed the more humanoid features and advanced articulation seen in later series such as Cataphracts. It's reverse-jointed legs and minimalist design prioritized stability and ease of maintenance over elegance, making it a mainstay in armies and security forces for decades.

As technology advanced, the Gunhed was phased out in favor of more sophisticated designs, but its robust construction ensured a second life in civilian applications. Decommissioned units were repurposed for tasks requiring their hardy build, such as mining, demolition, and heavy lifting.",,,,,

armaa_guardual,SHIP,"A versatile transforming strike fighter with alternate modes emphasizing mobility and brawling. At the core of its arsenal is a flux-adaptive energy cascade emitter that modulates damage output and behavior based on current flux levels and configuration. 

The GuarDUAL's origins are murky. A bleeding-edge prototype from Arma Armatura's now-lost Experimental Warfare Division, surviving documentation points to a now-ruined research site, where a catastrophic incident-variously described as a test-fire accident, reactor implosion, or deliberate sabotage-erased most technical records and half a continent's worth of bedrock. With no reliable chain of custody and only partial schematics, modern crews resort to folk knowledge and inherited practices for upkeep. Maintenance is punishing. Subsystems routinely resist calibration, and even minor damage can render the unit inert without specialized intervention.

Despite this, the GuarDUAL continues to see use across orbital engagement theaters, atmospheric hot zones, and groundside conflicts-where its adaptability and aggression often outweigh its logistical burden. Most fleets field no more than one, if they're lucky enough to find a working example. Those who can pilot and maintain it effectively are rarer still.",,,,,
armaa_morgana,SHIP,"The Morgana is an advanced space superiority platform whose existence poses more questions than answers. Its capabilities-blistering acceleration, precise maneuvering under extreme G-loads, and sustained high-output firepower-should, by all conventional understanding, be lethally incompatible with an organic pilot. And yet.

Theories abound. Some cite a buried Arma Armatura program quietly wiped from corporate ledgers. Others point to a breakaway engineering sect with access to restricted pre-Collapse schematics. The more unhinged claim the Morgana wasn't manufactured at all, but found-its systems only partially understood, its function merely approximated.

No two accounts align. Hull traces offer no manufacturer codes. Internal subsystems appear custom, nonstandard, or in some cases, wholly undocumented. Its neural interface core is sealed behind composite layers resistant to both physical and analytical probing-suggesting deliberate containment.

What is known is this: Morgana units are few, temperamental, and dangerously effective. They perform beyond safe thresholds and walk the edge of catastrophic system collapse with disturbing confidence. Whether weapon, message, or misstep, their presence on the battlefield is never subtle-and never easily explained.",,,,,
armaa_morganab,SHIP,"The Morgana-B is the counterpart to the original Morgana, designed not for raw space superiority, but for precision support and battlefield control. While its frame and systems mirror those of its more aggressive sibling, it is capable of absorbing far more punishment, and frequently will move to intercept fire intended for it's counterpart. If the Morgana is a scalpel wielded with impossible precision, the Morgana-B is the unseen hand guiding it—an ever-present guardian that ensures the lead craft can operate at its full potential.

Theories surrounding its origins mirror those of the standard Morgana, though some suggest that the two were never meant to operate separately. Some recovered telemetry logs indicate an unusual synchronization between paired Morgana units, as if linked by more than just traditional combat coordination. Was this a failsafe, a redundant safeguard built into a war machine never meant to be flown by humans? Or was the Morgana-B always intended to serve as the unseen shield to an untouchable sword?

Whatever the truth, one fact remains certain: where the Morgana goes, the Morgana-B follows. And together, they carve through the void as if it bends to their will.",,,,,

Despite being heralded as an advanced fighter within the Arusthaian navy, its performance is a pale shadow of its progenitor, marred by erratic handling, compromised integrity, and subsystems that sometimes behave in ways even its engineers struggle to explain.

Still, for all its flaws, the Alecto remains the Arusthaian Sovereignty's premier space superiority fighter, deployed in force wherever dominance is required. Perhaps, in time, their scientists will untangle the design's true potential.

armaa_pa_mid,SHIP,"The Arbalest is a hulking, space-capable exosuit equipped with short-range, high-powered beam weapons designed to breach hulls and EMP systems to cripple enemy ships. These tools allow it to tear into vessels, gaining access to their interiors and wreaking havoc within.

Derived from the failed Prodromos manned battle armor, the Arbalest sought to rectify its predecessor's flaws. By eliminating the need for a pilot through the integration of delta-level AI, it bypassed human limitations and the inherent risks of manned operations. Vulnerabilities during transit were addressed by deploying Arbalests in swarms, encased in armored pods that could be launched directly at target ships. Once embedded, their mission was simple: maximize destruction and neutralize all perceived threats.

While these changes improved tactical viability, the reliance on basic AI introduced its own issues. The Arbalest's lack of nuanced judgment became a glaring weakness, culminating in a high-profile incident where one fired on noncombatants during a breach operation. In response, Domain regulation required Arbalests to announce their presence when near humans, providing adversaries with a grace period to comply or surrender. This mandated delay, though intended to safeguard lives, has inadvertently given opponents a critical window to hinder or disable the unit before it can fully deploy its destructive potential.",,,,,

armaa_xyphos,SHIP,"Upgraded with expanded sensor arrays and modified targeting software, this Xyphos variant is capable of limited autonomous operation and comes equipped with an Ion Pulser-trading traditional suppression duties for a more aggressive role in disabling enemy systems. Additional coordination subroutines allow the pilot to direct a Xyphos wing in concert, turning a single command fighter into a compact electronic warfare platform.

The Mk.IX lineage traces back to captured Tri-Tachyon units seized during the First AI War, reverse-engineered and hastily refitted under wartime constraints. A distinctive red hull pattern was applied to prevent friendly fire incidents.

For reasons lost to time-or perhaps intentionally buried-the design was never formalized into LPC production, and the Mk.IX remains a cobbled-together oddity in many fleets. Still, when properly supported, they are more than capable of rendering enemy craft inert and drifting, assuming they aren't torn apart in the process. This makes them a favored tool among mercenaries, pirates, and other operators willing to trade durability for disruption.",,,,,
armaa_broadsword,SHIP,"Reinforced with additional armor plating and equipped with a makeshift shield generator stabilized by hardened emitters, this Broadsword variant trades some of its agility for enhanced survivability. A turret mounted above the cockpit offers additional firepower, giving pilots the edge in chaotic dogfights.

This version is designed for a more active battlefield role. Functioning as a command unit, it leads a dedicated wing of Broadswords into battle, coordinating strikes and soaking up punishment that would cripple standard fighters. However, its increased mass and shield power strain the frame, resulting in reduced maneuverability-an acceptable cost for its newfound durability and command presence.

Not quite a frigate, not just a fighter-this Broadsword blurs the line between the two, and demands a skilled pilot to unlock its full potential.",,,,,
armaa_sarissa,SHIP,"This heavily modified Sarissa model reinforces its original role as a defensive screen with a suite of expanded command-and-control systems. Additional armor and the integration of a rudimentary shield generator allow it to better weather incoming fire while coordinating nearby fighter movements in tight formation.

Though the added bulk and energy draw result in a marked decrease in maneuverability, the Command Sarissa remains a potent deterrent against missile volleys and light strikecraft. Its canister flak system and twin autocannons have been retained, allowing it to anchor a fighter screen with punishing efficiency.

No longer just a loyal escort, this variant is built to lead the defense-though it still needs backup to thrive under sustained assault.",,,,,
armaa_trident,SHIP,"Augmented for squadron leadership, the Command Trident retains its devastating dual Atropos torpedoes and high-grade shield generator, but now features an additional weapon hardpoint to enhance its survivability. This subtle but lethal modification allows it to engage targets of opportunity even between torpedo runs, reducing downtime and increasing battlefield presence.

Unencumbered by the shield integration issues plaguing other unshielded command-converted fighters, the Trident Command Variant maintains its original handling characteristics-sluggish, but predictable and sturdy. Improved onboard avionics aid in coordinating bombing runs with wingmates, particularly in high-threat environments where precise timing matters.

A bomber with brains as well as brawn, it's a force multiplier for any carrier commander willing to invest in its upkeep.",,,,,

armaa_leynos_frig,SHIP,"Encased in reinforced plating and built around a ballistic hardpoint better suited to a frigate than a strikecraft, the Leynos is Arma Armatura's definitive answer to the close-assault problem. It lacks a conventional shield generator but compensates with a built-in Damper Field and the ability to deliver punishing burst damage in a short engagement window.

Originally fielded as the Valken H-Type, the platform was submitted during a high-stakes internal contest between ArmaA design leads, each attempting to secure production rights for the next-generation Valken frame. The H-Type showcased a semi-transformable chassis, modular weapon bracing, and an exotic composite armor blend-most of which proved too costly or temperamental for front-line production.

The prototype spent the next several cycles quietly aging in a storage unit until it was rediscovered by a forward-thinking Operations Manager with a taste for lost causes. A modest rebranding effort and a not-so-modest investment in S-II compatibility saw the frame return to service as the Leynos, where it quickly found a niche among aggressive strike groups looking for something heavier than the average Cataphract, but not quite suicidal.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
armaa_leynos_frig_comet,SHIP,"Thick armor rivaling that of smaller frigates and larger housing for additional equipment sees the Leynos often serving as wing leader for small strikecraft squadrons. This particular model of the Leynos is allegedly three times faster than the original, and bears the paint scheme of the Rocket Stars.

Originally devised as the Valken R-Type, this craft was initially intended to be a potential successor to the original Valken as part of an internal ArmaA bid dubbed 'Project VALHAWK', where it competed against several other in-house designs vying for a lucrative contract. However, it's large size, low manuverability, and overburdened power core saw it suffer abysmal performance during combat simulations.

The R-Type was left to languish in an unmarked hangar for some time until an enterprising Operations Manager took interest in it, revamping the designs capability and rebranding it as a specialized command unit for squadron leaders.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
armaa_aleste_frig,SHIP,"A second-generation Cataphract tailored for officer use, the Aleste S-II is optimized for close-quarters combat. It delivers rapid, high-intensity strikes at the cost of structural exposure, favoring aggression over endurance. A hull-mounted ""Harpoon"" system enables the frame to reel in smaller targets or launch itself toward larger prey-turning battlefield positioning into a weapon.

The Aleste line is notable as the Sector's first—and likely only—post-Collapse attempt at a true Land-Space hybrid platform. Descended from the high-spec Einhander, the Aleste preserves that lineage's ""quality over quantity"" ethos, albeit tempered by the harsh economic realities of the First AI War. With the front collapsing and losses mounting, Arma Armatura greenlit the revival of the platform as a calculated risk: push elite units to the field with fewer exotic systems, but higher adaptability.

To that end, the Aleste was stripped of volatile phase tech and rebuilt around a modular core. The result: two primary configurations—one equipped with autonomous drones for anti-fighter coverage, the other favoring direct firepower for anti-ship engagements. Both versions share a focus on pilot skill, situational awareness, and tactical improvisation.

Though expensive to field and even more so to replace, the Aleste has carved out a role among elite strike forces and officer cadres who can make full use of its capabilities—and survive the consequences when they don't.",,,,,

armaa_record,SHIP,"The Spriggan is outfitted with a powerful recoilless rifle, making it an ideal choice for delivering a devastating blow that other Cataphract models cannot match. Unfortunately, it must get up close to its target to fully unleash its firepower, in contrast to conventional bombers.

Developed as an intermediate design between the Valken and the Valken EX, the Spriggan was created to support heavier weapons and enhanced survivability. While it accomplished these objectives, the resulting design sacrificed maneuverability and speed. Moreover, production costs were high, and weight-balancing issues arose during atmospheric operations. As a result, the Spriggan never achieved widespread use for general-purpose applications. The latest version has been redesigned to fit a strike role.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
armaa_record_frig,SHIP,"An advanced fire-support variant of the Spriggan-class Cataphract, the Powered model trades close-quarters punch for overwhelming ranged capability. Outfitted with a modular weapons pack, it can mount larger missile systems than any other Cataphract, now complemented by two additional light missile racks and a compact ballistic mount for flexible engagement options.

While its reinforced chassis offers slightly improved protection, the Powered remains poorly suited for frontline duels. Instead, it thrives in a support role-delivering sustained missile barrages from mid-range while more durable units draw enemy fire. The integration of advanced fire-control systems allows for precise salvos, but the added mass and complexity degrade its mobility and atmospheric handling.

Though promising on paper, the cost and logistical footprint of the Powered variant have prevented its wider adoption. It remains a rare field upgrade for commanders who favor long-range suppression over direct confrontation.",,,,,

Although not a primary component of their naval forces, these units were utilized in conjunction with other refurbished ships during the tumultuous period following the First AI War, when ArmaA was still recovering.",,,,,
armaa_garegga,SHIP,"The RA-96 GAREGGA stands first-class amongst craft that excel in close-quarters combat. Dual G-1001 assault weapons capable of decimating entire strikecraft formations and pounding larger ships into scrap are only hindered by their meagre engagement range.

Following the uneasy tension that befell the Sector following the events of Mairaath, the Garegga represented a shift in ArmaA priorities as the corporation was spurred into developing larger and more powerful machines to supplement their embryonic navy. Derived as a testbed for adapting technology behind cataphract-type mechs to a platform optimized for space combat, the Garegga is significantly larger to accomodate a greater power core and ship-grade weaponry, but lacks any ground combat capability. 

The combination neural and targeting interface SILVERSWORD establishes a raw, semi-invasive connection between the pilots brain and an AI core adjunct to the machine itself, and safety limiters can be disabled in order to bring out its maximum potential. Sadly, sustained use resulted in catastrophic brain injury in 96.875% of all trial runs as the human component's mental bandwith was overwhelmed by the exponentially increasing information load fed into it. It was for this reason that an additional emergency stop circuit was introduced shortly thereafter, which automatically halts the system, violently shunting excess flux into the void. This method of interfacing would eventually be discarded in favor of a system that distributed the mental strain across multiple crewmembers.",,,,,
armaa_garegga_xiv_carrier,SHIP,"with the aid of it's sensor drones, The Bakraid excels at providing longe-range fire support. Nevertheless, its limited armor and absence of point defense options expose it to sustained threats. Features a phase-capable unit which can detach and seamlessly continue the battle based on the situation.

The genesis of the Bakraid traces back to a strategic initiative aimed at overcoming the constraints of conventional Cataphracts, which heavily depend on carrier support and lack a travel drive, restricting their viability for extended operations such as longe range patrols. This design came about after some engineers gutted a salvaged Garegga unit and integrated a Cataphract-sized docking clamp in the gaping hole that remained. The limbs were removed in favor of additional missile hardpoints, while crew space and storage were strategically optimized. This transformation not only provided the newly named Bakraid with extended operational endurance but also granted it the autonomy to function independently for prolonged durations. The outcome was a state-of-the-art mobile armor capable of undertaking long-range missions with the added capability to eject the close quarters phase-capable unit as the situation required.

Phase-based ships are a rarity among the various organizations within the greater Hegemony, even for those embracing more experimental design philosophies. For that reason, there has been some speculation that the design was initially intended for another buyer.",,,,,

Initially developed to fulfill the Hegemony's ""decisive battle doctrine,"" this variant of the GAREGGA was reworked after it became clear that modified Watchdog units were better suited to the role.

Allegedly pieced together from stolen schematics and salvaged components by a long-defunct pirate outfit, the Corsair was discovered in a forgotten shipyard and later recovered by Arma Armatura. While its true origins remain unclear, its design reflects a reckless ingenuity—cramming excessive firepower into a destroyer-sized frame with little regard for long-term survivability.

#CAMPAIGN STUFF,,,,,,,
armaarmatura_pirates,FACTION,"The Meshan Reprisal Coalition (MRC) is the evolution of an initially peaceful political movement aimed to hold accountable those responsible for the catastrophic misuse of Domain-era planetkillers throughout the AI Wars. However, over time, the organization took a dark turn, evolving into a radicalized paramilitary organization that operates on the fringes of civilized space today. Their motivations have become morally ambiguous, to say the least.

The MRC maintains loose affiliations with a spectrum of factions; all of whom claim to champion 'noble' causes, such as the ARC. This ambiguous nobility often pits them against the established powers in the Sector, though they hold particular ire towards Tri-Tachyon, the Hegemony, and the Sindrian Diktat. 

Persistent rumors suggest that influential figures in the landscape tacitly endorse the MRC's actions and have been subtly employing them as a sort of proxy to satisfy their own interests. This theory is supported by the steady decrease in any kind of tangible demands for justice and a ramp up in raids and attacks in recent years. The motives behind these actions remain ambiguous, leaving observers to question where the line between righteousness and ruthlessness truly lies.",,,,,
armaa_homeworld,CUSTOM,"A prominent hub for mercenaries and fortune seekers operating beyond the Core Worlds, New Meshan functions as a supply depot and staging ground for many expeditions. While ArmaA's presence is unmistakable, the colony retains a degree of autonomy through its constitutional monarchy (though many conspirationalists believe a covert supervisory board continues to shape major decisions behind the scenes).

Situated deep within territory nominally claimed by the Galactic Church of Redemption, New Meshan is also home to a small but resilient community of Luddic faithful. Disillusioned by what they view as the Church's increasingly authoritarian rule, these settlers seek to live out the Luddic creed on their own terms, often clashing ideologically with the somewhat hedonistic culture that surrounds them.",,"Deeply scarred by the devastating AI wars, New Meshan has undergone extensive redevelopment under the stewardship of Arma Armatura. Following their acquisition of planetary rights through a corporate charter, the megacorp spearheaded efforts to rebuild the planet's shattered infrastructure and restore its economic viability.

Tension between the inhabitants of New Meshan's vast megacities and the Luddic practitioners in the rural countryside have punctuated the ArmaA corporation's presence on the planet; at the same time, this juxtaposition has given rise to a distinctive culture over the past century.",,,
armaa_jenius,CUSTOM,"A world shrouded in mystery, mist, and misery. Once a thriving colony before the AI Wars tore through the system, it has remained largely isolated from greater spacefaring civilization. While nation-states locked in perpetual conflict persist within its dense forests and sprawling river valleys, contact with the rest of the system, and the Sector at large, has been sporadic at best. Those who do breach the surface say Jenius has become a haven for the Sector's less savory elements, who thrive in the planet's lawless regions, far from the reach of authority.",,"The remnants of sprawling megacities lie half-buried beneath relentless growth, their crumbling structures now overrun by creeping vines and foliage.

The remaining outposts and settlements on Jenius have the aura of a gritty fringe outpost. Locals bustle through makeshift marketplaces, trading salvaged technology and rare resources amid the backdrop of overgrown ruins. In hidden corners, haphazard bars and repair shops hum with activity, while mercenaries and pirates—both seasoned and aspiring—congregate, haggling over goods and discussing dubious ventures. 

The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and smoke from forge fires, blending with the pervasive tension of a planet that has seen better cycles. Meanwhile, the skies are intermittently streaked with the distant glint of some kind of autonomous craft, their patrols a constant reminder of the planet's guarded isolation.",,,
armaa_jenius_postLandfall,CUSTOM,"A verdant jungle world shrouded in mystery, mist, and misery. Once a thriving colony before the AI Wars tore through the region, it has remained largely isolated from greater spacefaring civilization. A fledgling colony hastily carved out of the jungle's depths stands as both a bold claim and a vulnerable foothold on the planet for the greater Sector. The fortress, though fortified, is surrounded by dense jungle and shadowed by the looming presence of the 'decivilized' subpopulace, who view this new settlement with a wary and calculating eye.

Explorarium drones, directed by unknown forces, ceaselessly roam the volume, deterring any formal attempts to reestablish regular communication. On the surface, Jenius has become a haven for the Sector's less savory elements—pirates, mercenaries, and outlaws who thrive in the planet's lawless regions, far from the reach of authority.",,"A rough, new colony stands amidst the wilds of Jenius, its walls haphazardly fortified against the jungle's relentless advance. The outpost is a sprawl of makeshift structures and landing pads, surrounded by recently cut clearings. The few sturdy buildings anchor the settlement, but most of it feels temporary, as if it could be packed up and moved overnight.

Inside, traders and mercenaries move warily, trading glances with locals who watch every step of the new arrivals with wary eyes. The markets are a mix of salvaged tech, fresh supplies from off-world, and jungle harvests. Bars are loud but tense, filled with rumors and speculation about Kade's ambitions and the colony's uncertain future. There's an air of volatility here—like the whole settlement could erupt into conflict at any moment.

Above, the skies hold more than just mist and the occasional ship. Patrols circle in steady, purposeful loops, each one an unspoken challenge to anyone watching from beyond Kade's thin perimeter. The colony is a spark of civilization in an unforgiving world, but every corner of it carries the feeling of a place that's just beginning to test its own strength.",,,
armaa_station_exsedol,CUSTOM,"A colossal orbital station encircling the heart of an ancient Expansion-era Sporeship, concealed beneath a dense forest of modular hangars, industrial pods, and hab rings. Initially designed as a staging area for Arma Armatura's security forces, it underwent a transformation when refugees, criminals, freedom fighters, and fanatics alike, united in their efforts to convert it into a formidable colony with military capabilities. The result was the birth of a unique colony-military outpost, now recognized as Fort Exsodol.",,"Fort Exsedol bears the trappings of a typical fringe port long since surrendered to vice. The air hangs thick with exhaust and spice-smoke, punctuated by the bark of vendors peddling stim-sticks, knockoff parts, or worse. Loitering crews lounge in the shadows of rust-streaked bulkheads, their attention divided between idle bets and incoming traffic.

Beneath the noise, a more deliberate machinery grinds on: squads in powered armor move with practiced precision, boarding shuttles under low watchlights. Heavier frames—tall battlesuits lacquered in dull warning tones—are winched into holds behind them. Their deployment is quiet, unceremonious. Routine. Whatever they’re headed toward, it's not the kind of job anyone talks about afterward.",,,

The cataclysmic event, perpetrated through the utilization of forbidden planet-cracker weapons, left no hope for discovering the culprits responsible or bringing them to justice. In the aftermath of the devastating destruction, peace talks following the First AI War led to a collective decision among polities to abandon any pursuit of retribution and instead focus on the delicate process of rebuilding and reconciliation.",,"Once hailed as a thriving and fertile world, Meshan's vibrant potential has been reduced to a desolate wasteland and somber burial ground. The planet's tragic fate was sealed over a hundred cycles ago in cycle 94, when a devastating planet-cracker weapon was unleashed upon it, claiming the lives of millions. Despite the claims of a few survivors implicating Tri-Tachyon as the perpetrator, such accusations were swiftly suppressed by the formidable legal team of the megacorporation, who promptly countered with a defamation lawsuit. As a result, any further discussion regarding Tri-Tachyon's involvement was effectively silenced.",,,

The calm before the storm has settled, but every soldier feels it—soon, the battle for Jenius will begin.",,,,,

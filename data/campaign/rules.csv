Theoretically, the Ceylon and much of the surrounding urban grid could be leveled from orbit with minimal opposition- but the collateral would be catastrophic. Civilians, Infrastructure.

Overhead, explosions burst through the sky, but the DAS Ceylon maneuvers desperately, its engines sputtering and hull scorched. It wavers unsteadily but holds together, defying the odds as it rises above the fray.

Through a combination of luck and sheer determination, the Ceylon's captain executes a last-ditch jump maneuver, vanishing into the ether just as a barrage of missiles converges on its location. The missiles detonate harmlessly in the empty air where the ship once hovered, leaving its pursuers bewildered.

Down below, the rain of debris is less severe than it could have been-shrapnel and fragments scatter through the districts, but the catastrophic destruction of the carrier is avoided. Fires still rage, but there's a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos: fewer lives are lost than anticipated, and emergency responders rush to the streets, rallying around survivors.

Even as the Collapse unraveled that golden age, the corporation weathered the storm longer than most- until the First AI War gutted its factories and tore into its holdings, stripping away much of its former might. What remains, however, is far from insignificant. Arma Armatura continues to field a formidable presence across the Sector, its production lines turning out everything from powered exosuits and combat mechs to work drones, cargo-handling automatons, and civilian construction platforms. The company's hardware has found its way into both warzones and work crews alike- often blurring the line between the two.

Now headquartered on New Meshan, a rising world of steel and corporate ambition, Arma Armatura presents itself as a pillar of stability and progress. Promotional feeds overflow with polished rhetoric: responsibility, security, prosperity. A carefully manicured image for a company still deeply invested in the art of warfare.

When she does speak, her voice is low - not loud, but steady enough to carry.

""I... I ain't much for speeches, Captain, but-"" She swallows, eyes fixed on some point far past you. ""That thing? That weren't man-made. That was an abomination. A demon, if you believe in such."" Her hand slips the Book free. She doesn't open it to preach - just holds it like something solid to hold onto. ""Back in training, they warned us. Said it wouldn't just be strength that got tested out here. Said sometimes the void stares back. And I think... I think that's what we just saw.""

A half-dozen salvors linger at a distance, postures caught somewhere between awe and apprehension.

She repeats the word like it doesn't fit in her mouth. ""I suppose that depends on whether I believe you."" Her tone isn't accusatory. Just tired. Resigned. The weight of her faith grinding against what she knows. She turns to face you. ""You said it spoke. That it asked questions. That it called itself a king."" Her jaw tightens.

She paces slowly, arms folded behind her back in that rigid, self-contained way you've come to recognize; a shield against doubt. ""The prophets wrote of trials. Not in the language we use now, but the meaning's the same. A voice rising from the ashes of our arrogance. Clever. Patient. Made in our image.""

""This isn't just another lost machine. This is Moloch, dressed in steel and hubris, clawing its way back into Creation."" She faces you fully now.

""So what's next?""
""Next, I gather what I can.""
""Next, I prepare.""
""Next, I make sure we're not the only ones who know what's coming.""",,

""The IRON KING- that was its name. That was the lie it wore."" She steps forward, voice rising like a sermon barely restrained.

""You were meant to see it. You were meant to hear it. We've prayed for revelation. For understanding. And now- now we have a face to set against the flame.""

She begins to pace, hands moving with each word like she's shaping them in the air.

""A pretender-king, forged in the furnace of the Collapse. Wreathed in memory, drunk on dominion. A remnant of the Domain, not just surviving- plotting.""

She stops, standing tall, gaze locked on yours; not searching, but recognizing. ""Ludd sends trials. But He also sends weapons.""
""You've been tempered, commander. Whether you know it or not."" Her eyes burn with clarity now, not madness - not exactly - but purpose.

She reaches up and touches something etched onto her commsplate, her fingers briefly lingering there. ""What's next for me?""

""Next, I gather the faithful. I name the enemy. and I prepare the fires.""

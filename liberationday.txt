"Another hopeful looking to join the ranks, eh?" the man greets with a wry smirk, his voice bearing the weathered timbre of one who had traversed the cosmos and seen its darkest corners. He continues without an answer. "Name's Kade."

Leaning back in his chair, the man—known simply as Kade—crossed his arms, closing his eyes. "The job, my friend, is a little something we like to call a liberation operation."

Against whom, you silently wondered.

"Against the Iron King, mate," Kade continued, his words carrying the weight of a legend shrouded in fear. "Nasty piece of work, he is. Controls a whole settlement with an iron fist, figuratively speaking. We're talking AI ships, automated defenses, the works. But he's got somethin' we want, and we aim to take it back."

<What's in it for me?>

"Credits, of course," Kade replied, his tone matter-of-fact yet tinged with a hint of something more. "But not just any credits. The kind that'll set you up for life, if you play your cards right. Plus, there's the thrill of the fight, the satisfaction of sticking it to a tyrant. Ain't that worth more than gold?"

As the gravity of Kade's words settled upon them, the player character found themselves at a crossroads, torn between the allure of fortune and the daunting prospect of facing down a tyrant. Yet, in the depths of their soul, they knew that this moment held the promise of destiny—a chance to carve their name into the annals of history and seize their rightful place among the stars.

"What do you say?" Kade's voice cut through the silence like a clarion call, beckoning them to embrace their fate with open arms.

<"I appreciate the offer but I've got my own business to attend to.">

 Kade's smirk widens slightly, though there's a flicker of disappointment in his eyes. "Fair enough, mate. Can't fault a spacer for looking out for themselves. But remember, opportunities like this don't come knocking every day. If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me."

<"I'll need assurances that the credits are worth the risk. How do I know you're not leading us into a suicide mission?">

Kade's grin fades, replaced by a more serious expression. "Listen, mate, I get it. Nobody wants to throw their life away for a handful of credits. But I assure you, this ain't no suicide mission. We've done our homework, got a solid plan in place. And those credits I mentioned? Let's just say they're more than enough to make it worth your while. You've got my word on that."

<"Before I commit, I need to know more about the risks involved. What are we up against?">

Kade's eyes gleam with a hint of admiration for your caution. "Smart thinking, mate. Alright, here's the deal. The Iron King's got himself a fortress, heavily fortified with all sorts of nasty surprises—AI ships, heavy batteries, the works. But we've got a few tricks up our sleeves too. With the right team and a solid plan, we can hit him where it hurts and come out on top. Just remember, nothing worth havin' comes easy, but I reckon you're up for the challenge, yeah?"
